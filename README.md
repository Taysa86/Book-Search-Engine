# Book-Search-Engine

# Description
A search engine using the Google Books API that has been refactored from a RESTful API setup to a GraphQL API. I ran into a ton of errors with this one. I think it would have been easier to rebuild the API fron scratch using GraphQL than trying to convert it over from a RESTful API.

# Install
    N/A

# Usage


# Credits
My instructor Charlie and the TA's helped a ton with fixing errors in this. I had to uninstall and reinstall bcrypt for some reason, among many other things.
